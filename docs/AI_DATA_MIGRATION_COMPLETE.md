# 🤖 AI Data Migration Complete

## ✅ What Was Done

### Removed All Mock Data

- ❌ Removed hardcoded job listings from JobSwiper
- ❌ Removed hardcoded applications from ApplicationTracker
- ❌ Removed hardcoded offers from OfferComparison
- ✅ All data now generated by AWS Bedrock AI

### Created AI Generation Service

**Backend:**

- ✅ `server/services/jobGenerationService.js` - AI job generation service
- ✅ `server/routes/aiJobs.js` - API routes for AI data
- ✅ Integrated with AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Haiku

**API Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/ai-jobs/generate` - Generate personalized jobs
- `POST /api/ai-jobs/applications` - Generate applications
- `POST /api/ai-jobs/offers` - Generate offer comparisons

### Updated Frontend Components

**JobSwiper (`src/components/JobSwiper.tsx`):**

- ✅ Loads AI-generated jobs on mount
- ✅ Uses user profile for personalization
- ✅ Shows loading state while generating
- ✅ Generates 15 personalized jobs

**ApplicationTracker (`src/components/ApplicationTracker.tsx`):**

- ✅ Loads AI-generated applications
- ✅ Generates 5 realistic applications with different statuses
- ✅ Personalized based on user profile

**OfferComparison (`src/components/OfferComparison.tsx`):**

- ✅ Loads AI-generated offers
- ✅ Generates 3 competitive offers
- ✅ Realistic salary, equity, and benefits data

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. User Profile → AI Personalization

When a user completes onboarding, their profile is saved:

```javascript
{
  currentRole: "Student",
  targetRole: "Software Engineer",
  skills: ["JavaScript", "React", "Python"],
  experience: "Entry level",
  location: "San Francisco, CA",
  salaryExpectation: 120000
}
```

### 2. AI Generates Personalized Data

Each component calls the AI service with the user profile:

**JobSwiper:**

```javascript
const response = await fetch("/api/ai-jobs/generate", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userProfile: { ...profile },
    count: 15,
  }),
});
```

**AI Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "job-1",
    "company": "Amazon",
    "title": "Junior Software Engineer",
    "location": "San Francisco, CA",
    "salary": "$110k - $140k",
    "matchScore": 92,
    "description": "Perfect for new grads...",
    "tags": ["JavaScript", "React", "AWS"],
    "source": "ai-generated"
  }
]
```

### 3. Real-Time Generation

- Jobs generated fresh each time
- Personalized to user's profile
- Realistic companies, salaries, descriptions
- Match scores based on profile fit
