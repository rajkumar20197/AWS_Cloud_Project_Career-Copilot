## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Keep it simple** - Gemini works best with clear, straightforward descriptions
2. **Specify duration** - Mention "5 seconds" or "quick 3-second clip"
3. **One main action** - Focus on one key movement or event per clip
4. **Lighting matters** - Mention "warm lighting" or "blue screen glow"
5. **Style consistency** - Use similar descriptors across clips ("cinematic", "modern", "professional")
6. **Avoid complex scenes** - Multiple characters or intricate actions may not work well

## 🔄 If Generation Fails

## 📊 Recommended Generation Order

1. **Start with simple clips** (logo, text screens)
2. **Then try character clips** (student studying, celebrating)
3. **Finally try complex animations** (UI interfaces, data visualizations)

If complex clips don't work, use screen recordings of your actual app instead!

## 🎯 Fallback Strategy

If Gemini video generation isn't working well:

1. **Generate still images** with the prompts from GEMINI_VIDEO_PROMPTS.md
2. **Use image-to-video** feature to animate them
3. **Record your actual app** with OBS for UI shots
4. **Combine everything** in CapCut

This hybrid approach often works better than pure text-to-video!

**Try these simplified prompts one at a time!** 🎥

Start with the simplest ones (logo, text) and work up to more complex scenes.
